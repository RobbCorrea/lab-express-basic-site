    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><h3>Have you ever been to a Robocup match?</h3></br>
        Robocup is an inter-college robotics contest where students from 
        different universities build their robots and make them battle
        in different competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's <strong><a href="https://www.robocupjunior.org.au/sites/default/files/Soccer/DSC04977.jpg">Robo-Soccer</a></strong>, 
        where basically students build Lego robots programed to chase a ball emitting infrared light.
    </p>
    <p><h3>Then there's <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/BDaborMhqCYWQ/giphy.gif">Mini-sumo</a></h3>
        This is somewhat the favorite for many mechatronics and robotics 
        students. Why? Because building robots can be fairly costly.
        Even building small robots is not cheap. So, building a Mini-sumo
        robot, is both, accesible and a great challenges for newcomer 
        engineering students.
